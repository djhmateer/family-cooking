## Exploration of Technologies

- Next.js 15
- ShadCN UI
- Drizzle
- Postgres (Supabase) 
- Zod
- React Hook Form

For the above I'm aiming for the simplest possible implementations

Inspired by [Traversy Media ecommerce sample](https://www.traversymedia.com/products/next-js-ecommerce/) for ShadCN setup and overall UI concept.

Then

- Auth
- tRPC

Am using - Github and Vercel for continuous deployment.

Am doing markdown user stores below inspired by [Dave Gray Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djDgTYrFMAY)
